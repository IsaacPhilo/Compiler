This project began in the Introduction to Compiler Design extracurricular certification course at UT Dallas, in the spring of 2024.
This compiler's purpose is to turn code into an LLVM IR file for further compilation.

See xarkenz.github.io/icd for the relevant course materials.

This project is also an exploration of extensible, self-describing hierarchical class design.
